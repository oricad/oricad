# Oricad

Oricad is a computer-aided origami design tool. This includes, but is not
limited to, crease pattern design, step-by-step folding, tesselation support,
and diagramming.

_**This is still in early stages of development**_

The geometric backend is provided by [CGAL], the visualisation of origami
objects is performed by the [VTK] library.
The user interace is made with [Qt].
